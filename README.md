# University-Database-Design 🏫

## Use 👨🏻‍💻

For this project, I was able to develop a design for a university and its structure all around. The main concept of the design is to show how structured and
well-functioning a back-end design of a school network can be and how to do it. This project was developed as an assignment for the second year of my studies 
and was built with the help of MySQL and Microsoft Access software.
